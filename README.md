# pm4py-test
As part of a challenge orgonized by Roche.
### The problematic:
Having rich data with no use: 

-The real world population-level oncology data is rich with information
-The data is case-specific
-Treatment pathways granularity makes it hard to extract insights

### Project Description:
An evaluation and optimization of patients healthcare:
- Use a set of metrics to calculate the significance that would help abstract from undesired details (delete or cluster)
- Visualisation of an Adaptive Graph Simplification
- Evaluation with a predictive analysis 
- Actionable insights allowing additional analysis
# Key Questions

- “How does the process currently look like?”
- “Are there waste and unnecessary steps or bottlenecks that could be eliminated?” 
-  “Can we generate patient pathways with zoom-in features where high-level and more detailed views of the data are presented to the user?” 
- “Can we use predictive models to enable patient care optimization?”

#State of the Art:
- Mining softwares: ProM  , Fluxicon’s Disco
- R packages: processmapR within the bupaR ecosystem.
- Python packages: PM4PY.
- Process mining techniques:The alpha algorithm, the inductive miner, the heuristic miner, and the fuzzy miner.

Problems with Real world population-level healthcare data: Random number of seemingly unrelated events makes “Spaghetti-like” drawings.
